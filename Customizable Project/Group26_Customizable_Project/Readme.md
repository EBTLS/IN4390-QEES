### Readme



There are three parts in the folder

1. .pdf is our report for the tool

2. .pptx is the slides used for the presentation

3. A step-by-step video for the Demo Question 2

4. Demo Folder has three demos. 

   1. Question 2, is the demo corresponding to the step-by-step video
   2. Afek_Gafani is a model of Afek Gafani election algorithm. We use it to show the strong ability of TLA+ to model systems/algorithms, especially concurrent and distributed ones
   3.  is another demo

   We only made step-by-step video for Demo Question 2. Because it is sufficient to illustrate the basic grammar of TLA+ and basic usage of TLA Toolbox. There is no large difference among three demos, only different in models. So, we believe one model is enough.
