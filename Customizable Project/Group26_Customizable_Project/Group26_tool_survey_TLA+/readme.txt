Demo(.tla):
1. In demo 1, we modeled the sysytem in the assignment 2 mandatory question 2 and check two properties mentioned in the question2.2 & 2.3.
2. In demo 2, we modeled the sysytem in the assignment 2 mandatory question 1 and checked the whether the system is deadlock free.
3. In demo 3, Afek_Gafani is a model of Afek Gafani election algorithm. We used it to show the strong ability of TLA+ to model systems/algorithms, especially concurrent and distributed ones 
(Follow the video guide to open the toolbox and copy the code in .tia file, the whole modeling process can be reproduced)

Video guide(.mp4):
4. The step-by-step video guide shows the basic usage and workflow on TLA+, and uses the demo 1 as example. It is sufficient to illustrate the basic grammar of TLA+ and basic usage of TLA Toolbox

Reprot and presentation:
5. A report of tool survey(.pdf) and the presentation PPT(.pptx) are given.
